/**
 * \brief The default timeslot timing in the standard is a guard time of
 * 2200 us, a Tx offset of 2120 us and a Rx offset of 1120 us.
 * As a result, the listening device has a guard time not centered
 * on the expected Tx time. This is to be fixed in the next iteration
 * of the standard. This can be enabled with:
 * TxOffset: 2120
 * RxOffset: 1120
 * RxWait:   2200
 *
 * Instead, we align the Rx guard time on expected Tx time. The Rx
 * guard time is user-configurable with TSCH_CONF_RX_WAIT.
 * (TxOffset - (RxWait / 2)) instead
