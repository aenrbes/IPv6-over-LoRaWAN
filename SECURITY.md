# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We will always apply vulnerability fixes on branch `develop` and include them
in the next release. Depending on the severity, we will consider hotfixing
the most recent release too. Older releases will not be hotfixed.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| branch `develop` | :white_check_mark: |
| [latest release](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/releases/latest)   | :question:                |
| older releases   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability privately please email security@contiki-ng.org

We will try to confirm or decline your report ASAP by email. For accepted
vulnerability reports we will create an [advisory](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories)
and, if you wish, invite you to the discussion.
