This example is intended to run on a mode that is connected to a native host
system by SLIP. Full IEEE 802.15.4 packets are transmitted over slip, turning
the mote into a simple radio, with the RPL and 6LoWPAN stack running on the
host. This is typically used with the native border router (example
`rpl-border-router` on target native).
